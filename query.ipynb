You can think about the pdf page in terms of X-Y coordinates. The X-axis spans the width of the PDF page and the Y-axis spans the height of the page. Every element has its bounds defined by a bounding box which consists of 4 coordinates. These coordinates (X0, Y0, X1, Y1) represent left, bottom, right and top of the text box, which would give us the location of data we are interested in the PDF page.\n",

In the following, we write a function to use “pdf.pq(‘LTTextLineHorizontal:overlaps_bbox(“#, #, #, #”)’).text()” to extract the data inside each textbox, then use pandas to construct a dataframe.
